                <img src="./images/blokkies.png" alt="">
                <p>For my first programming assignment, I was tasked with creating a basic adventure game using Javascript. I took this opportunity to develop a game called Dragon Slayer. The game is designed to be a simple experience that utilizes basic
                    Javascript and DOM manipulation to change various elements such as dialogue boxes and background. The simplicity of the coding and the game mechanics makes it accessible to players of all skill levels. <br><br> This project was a great
                    opportunity for me to showcase my understanding of Javascript, which is the foundation of web development. It allowed me to demonstrate my ability to create a functional game using only basic programming concepts. The game may be simple
                    in nature but it allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the potential of Javascript and the importance of user experience in game development.</p>

                <img src="./images/blokkies.png" alt="">
                <p>For the frontend development project, I was tasked with recreating a website that I personally used. I chose the website of a clothing retailer called Weekday. The recreation process presented a challenge as the original website utilized
                    several new CSS properties and HTML elements that I had not yet encountered.<br> Through researching and familiarizing myself with these new design elements, I was able to create a polished and visually appealing design, while also
                    prioritizing accessibility and responsiveness for the website.
